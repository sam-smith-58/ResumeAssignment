          <h1>Samantha Smith</h1>
          <h2>Aspiring Graphic and Web Designer</h2>
          <p>Hello, there! Thank you for taking the time to read my resume.</p>
          <p>I have worked in the customer service industry for a very long time. Although the switch from customer service to design may seem random, I think the skills I learned through my previous jobs will help me in the future. Especially my ability to listen to customers and make their concerns my focus.</p>
          <p>As I step into the design world, I know I'm not creating projects just for myself. My client's concerns will take center-stage, as I develop ideas for them.</p>
          <p>I'm very excited to learn and take a dive into design!</p>
        </div>

         <section class="project-item">
            <img src="images/fierce-spirit.jpg" alt="red and purple soap bar with a black cardboard sleeve that says fierce spirit enclosed in a flame">
            <h3>Fierce Spirit</h3>
            <p>For my Computer Design Tech course, we were tasked with creating a soap brand based on a phrase we chose. I went with "Fierce Spirit, focusing on a fire theme. After developing the logo, I went on to do a realistic mockup.</p>
            <p>My favorite part of this piece was creating the marble flame for the logo. Using the twirl tool in Illustrator, I created many versions of this product in different color schemes. I use this marble effect for other projects too because of how fun it is.</p>

          <!-- Project 2---------------->
          <section class="project-item">
            <img src="images/puppy-poke.png" alt="a yellow dog surfing a wave with a hibiscus behind his ear">
            <h3>Puppy Poke</h3>
            <p>In Graphic Design II, I was asked to design a dog treat brand that represented summer vacation. I came up with the brand, Puppy Poke, with Hawaii in mind.</p>
            <p>I love illustrating, however I don't often get to illustrate for myself. This project gave me a lot of freedom to create something fun for my audience, as well as myself.</p>

         <!-- Project 3---------------->
          <section class="project-item">
            <img src="images/wigglebeast.png" alt="a purple triangular-headed monster with three eyes and four arms">
            <h3>The Three-Eyed Wigglebeast</h3>
            <p>My Technical Illustration course included a project about designing stickers for a made-up company that sent monster stickers monthly. This project taught me many new skills about adding texture, outlines, and layers to my designs.
            </p>

         <!-- Project 4--------------->
          <section class="project-item">
            <img src="images/saw-project-thumb.png" alt="a table saw shown in gray and white">
            <h3>Skil Saw Isometric Drawing</h3>
            <p>Also from my Technical Illustration class, this was my final project of the course. It involved creating a realistic rendition of a table saw (the product that I chose) that could be used in a manual.</p>
            <p>This  project taught me how to apply textures to 3D objects and how to render them realistically.</p>
